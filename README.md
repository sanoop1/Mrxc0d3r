Mrx - Mrx two-factor authentication for Unix systems

Mrx provides simple two-factor authentication as a service.

This package allows an admin (or ordinary user) to quickly add Mrx
authentication to any Unix login without setting up secondary user
accounts, directory synchronization, servers, or hardware.
